Bugs are the type of error , faults and flaws in a computer program or software which restricts our code to not behave as it was want to be. \
Debugging is the process of removing such bugs which restricts our program in proper functioning.Various ways pf Debugging are:
* Describing the bug: Describing what the program is supposed to do and then jotting down the what the bug is doing.
* Print function: Using print function to check where the progam is going haywire.
* Fixing errors: Finding obvious errors highlighted by the IDEs.
* Debugger : Using in-built debugger and other debuggers to check step-by-step what the program is doing .
