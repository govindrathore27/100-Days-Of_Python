  * In this project, I have tried to make a simpler version of higher lower game , using the data already compiled and stored \
    in [game data](https://github.com/govindrathore27/100-Days-Of_Python/blob/main/Day-014/game_data_higher_lower.py) within a list containing dictionaries. In this we compare who has more follower count and then score is calculated based on our guess.
