In today's project , I used all my past knowledge about turtle library to create this game.
### Features:
- The cars are being generated randomly with a 1/6 chance and each time the level goes up the speed of the cars will increase.
- The player or the turtle can only move up using the "Up" arroy key, any other movement is not allowed.
- Scoreboard is managing the level.
